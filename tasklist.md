#  Stock Management System

## Project Overview:
The Stock Management System (SMS) is a Python-based application designed to help businesses manage their stock inventory efficiently. It allows users to add, update, delete, and search for products, track stock levels, manage suppliers and more.

## Features:
1. **Authentication System:**
    - Only authorized users (administrators/managers) can access the system.
    - Username and password authentication.

2. **Product Management:**
    - Add new products to the inventory.
    - Update existing product details like name, price, quantity, etc.
    - Delete products from the inventory.

3. **Stock Tracking:**
    - Track stock levels of products.
    - Receive new stock and update inventory.
    - Record sales and deduct stock accordingly.

4. **Supplier Management:**
    - Add new suppliers.
    - Update supplier details such as name, contact information, etc.
    - Remove suppliers from the system.

5. **Purchase Orders:**
    - Generate purchase orders for low stock items.
    - Record purchase orders and update inventory upon receipt.
6. **Search Functionality:**
    - Search for products by name, category, barcode, or supplier.
    - Search for suppliers by name or contact information.

7. **Data:**
    - Store inventory data in a file.

## Technologies Used:
- Python programming language.
- Standard libraries like `os`, `datetime`, `csv`, `pandas` for file handling, date/time operations, and CSV file manipulation.
- Basic data structures like lists, dictionaries for storing and managing data.
- Command-line interface for user interaction.

## Project Structure:
1. **Main Module (`main.py`):**
    - Contains the main logic of the application.
    - Handles user authentication and menu navigation.

2. **Product Module (`product.py`):**
    - Functions related to product management (add, update, delete, search).

3. **Stock Module (`stock.py`):**
    - Functions related to stock tracking (receive stock, record sales, update stock levels).

4. **Supplier Module (`supplier.py`):**
    - Functions related to supplier management (add, update, delete, search).

5. **Purchase Order Module (`purchase_order.py`):**
    - Functions to generate purchase orders for low stock items.

6. **Data Module (`data.py`):**
    - Handles data persistence (read/write data to files).

7. **Utils Module (`utils.py`):**
    - Utility functions used across modules.

## User Interaction:
- Upon running the application, users are prompted to log in with their username and password.
- After successful authentication, users are presented with a menu of options to perform various tasks.
- Users can navigate through the menu by entering corresponding numbers/options.

## Additional Considerations:
- Error handling: Implement robust error handling to handle unexpected inputs and scenarios gracefully.
- Logging: Implement logging to record significant events and errors for debugging and auditing purposes.
- Documentation: Include inline comments and documentation to make the codebase understandable and maintainable.
- OOP: use object-oriented programming principles for code organization and modularity.
